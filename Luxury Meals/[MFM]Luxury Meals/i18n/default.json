This device can extract the DNA sequence of animal products, and then gradually clone a piece of animal meat by modifying the cell structure. During the whole process, the animal will not be injured at all! ^Currently the equipment can only create steak with a large pot of milk, but I think I will finish this project in the future. The current blueprint is enclosed and sent to you.^^ -Demetrius",
