Sometimes you may even find a rare variant of Goldfish, depending on the season. There is quite the variety year round! The mountain lake is also a great spot to fish, as it is abundant with species: Carps, Chubs, Bullheads and Largemouth Bass live in this area all year around, while others, such as the Zebra Tilapia and Arowana, can only be found there during certain seasons.^ And don't forget that some fish prefer rainy weather.^^-Good Luck Fishing!",

Some have even been spotted in Cindersap Pond! And be sure not to miss out on the Dorado, Rainbow Trout, and Tucunare in the rivers as well, since they won't be back to these warm river waters until this time next year. There should be pretty interesting fish to catch at the ocean as well, such as Red Mullet, Robalo, and Red Snapper. And if you haven't caught a Ladyfish or Anchoviella yet, take the opportunity to do so because soon they will be gone! But beware of the Sea Snakes, for on rainy days, they go hunting.^^-Good Luck Fishing!",
