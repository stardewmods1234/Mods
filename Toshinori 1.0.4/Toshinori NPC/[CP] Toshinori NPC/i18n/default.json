Because he was fun, and nice, and he'd talk to us about real things. He'd help us work through real problems.#$b#And even if he wasn't super great at academics... he prepared us for real life. He taught us how to deal with conflict. He taught us how to manage money. How to navigate relationships.#$b#Important stuff.#$b#I honestly... don't know what I'll do without him.#$b#He is... he was... the father I never had.$4#$b#...$5",

The best thing I can settle on is, we should remember him as he was, not... as he ended up.$s#$b# That would be the best way to honor his memory, to remember his kindness and love when he was shining brilliantly.$s",

Perhaps it was all I could do. Perhaps it was not, on either fronts.$s#$b# But I do know this; my love for the friendship I had with Toshinori Yagi will never waver, and, in Yoba's hands, he will find life and joy again.",

He LOVED this world, and the people in it.$s#$b# He had his close family and friends, but sometimes... sometimes, it just isn't enough.$s#$b# Sometimes, it feels like you're pouring yourself into a void that can never be filled, and you can't always get back what you give.$s#$b# He was tired. Who can blame him? I could have done more. We ALL could have.$s#$b# But... it does us no good to dwell about what could have-- or SHOULD have-- been.$s#$b# Instead... we need to change. We have to be better. DO better. We're here. We have the strength. We have the will.$s#$b# And for all Toshinori gave to us, it's only the least we can do. It's time to go beyond.",

His dream was to teach children and raise them up with his ideals: that the world is kind, filled with good people, and brimming with oppertunity.#$b#But when duty called him and Kent to the frontlines, he followed without question.#$b#He came back alive. He came back with a smile on his face, strength in his soul, and a love for the world that was unbroken.#$b#He was a soul that brought joy to many, and his legacy will live on forever.#$b#Those who knew and loved him, please step forward.

I blamed myself, partially, feeling like I let him get hurt.$s#$b# But... what would have happened to me, if not for him? I couldn't have survived what he went through.$s#$b# But I owed him.

"6617.Harvey.1": "I've noticed you've been becoming friends with my patient, Mr. Yagi. As I'm sure you've noticed, he’s staying in the long-term ward. I think he appreciates making a friend.#$b#He moved here a few weeks ago from Zuzu City, kind of like you. The air here is very clean, and the valley is a calm, peaceful place.#$b#It’s good for his health.$h",
"6617.Harvey.2": "I'm very happy to see Toshinori thriving so much. I feel safe entrusting him to your care, but please let me know if anything happens to him.#b#I know I can be... overbearing, but it's my job as a doctor to worry about his health.$s#b#And now, it's your job, too.", 
"6617.Harvey.3": "I... overheard what Toshinori said about me. Thanks, for... you know. Getting that out of him.$s#$b#It was important that I heard it. I didn't realize I was making him so uncomfortable. And he's right, too. I was kind of making it about myself. #$b#When I worry like that, it makes him become my emotional nurse, and that's not fair to him.#$b#It really is hard to be a small town doctor. It's... hard to find that balance between emotional distance and vulnerability. But I'll try to do better.",
"6617.Harvey.4": "Toshinori's son Izuku is staying in the hospital for a while. He was already treated for his burns and injuries in a Zuzu City hospital, but I'm in charge of his aftercare.#$b#The damage was... extensive. It's a wonder the boy's still up and moving around. But it's good for him to stay active.#$b#I feel terrible for Toshinori as well... to almost lose your son like that... I can't imagine how it feels.",
"6617.Harvey.5": "Hey, @, have you seen Toshinori anywhere? I'm starting to worry. He missed an appointment.",
"6617.Harvey.6": "Toshinori's been coming to me less in regards to refills for his medication.#$b# Which means I KNOW he isn't taking them.$a",
"6617.Harvey.7": "I don't specialize in mental health treatment, but I always feared Toshinori might be dealing with PTSD. He shut down every time I tried to bring it up.#$b#I'm glad he's getting help.",
"6617.Harvey.8": "The clinic is rather quiet without Toshinori, now.$s#$b#I used to enjoy the silence. It was peaceful. Now, though... it's haunting.#$b# I... it was really hard taking care of Toshinori when he... when I had to prepare him for... whatever comes next.$s",

//Lewis
"6617.Lewis.1": "I'm glad you're becoming friends with Mr. Yagi. I think he feels like he has a hard time fitting in.#$b#Don't see why, though. Everyone seems to like him just fine.#$e#Well. Almost everyone...$s",
"6617.Lewis.2": "Having weddings in Pelican Town always fills my heart with pride!$h#b#I hope you and Toshinori live a long and healthy life together.",
"6617.Lewis.3": "I assumed Toshinori might have children, based on how paternal he is with Vincent and Jas. It's nice to meet Izuku.#$b#I just wish it were under... happier circumstances.#$b#As mayor of Pelican Town, I'll make sure his stay is as comfortable as possible.",
"6617.Lewis.4": "George is... a little old-fashioned and grouchy, but I'm shocked Toshinori thought so poorly of him.#$b#And more shocked that he lashed out as he did. It's unlike him.",
"6617.Lewis.5": "First George, now Demetrius?#$b#I admit, Toshinori seems to be under the weather as of late.#$b#At least, as selfish as it is to say, I hope that's all it is. He seemed rather upset with me, too.",
"6617.Lewis.6": "I'm wary about this new pattern of behavior Toshinori is showing. After how he treated Pam, I think I'm finally going to have a talk with him.",
"6617.Lewis.7": "Kent said that he talked to you about what's been going on with Toshinori.#$b#I can't begin to understand how it feels to deal with PTSD, but I know it must be terrible. I hope he gets help.",
"6617.Lewis.8": "I'm so relieved Toshinori has a friend like you to depend on in his low points.#$b# I was really worried where his mindset was going to lead him.",
"6617.Lewis.9":  "This town feels a lot smaller, now. It's one of my greatest fears, to see it go completely.$s#$b#Losing Toshinori, of all people though...$s#$b#It was good of Izuku to come out here to help with the service and final preparations. I can't imagine how hard this must be for him.",
 
//Haley

"6617.Haley.2": "Mmm. That Izuku guy is pretty cute. It's a real shame he's been hurt so bad, otherwise I might've asked him out.",
"6617.Haley.3": "I'm not going to pretend to know a lot about being a gay guy or queer guy or whatever, but if Toshinori feels empowered wearing a dress, then that's good. He probably doesn't get to experience that feeling a lot otherwise.#$b# ... Do you think he'd let me ask him to do a photoshoot?",
"6617.Haley.4": "Did you hear? Toshinori's been yelling at almost everyone in town! I didn't know he had it in him, he's usually so well-mannered!",
"6617.Haley.5": "So, in case you were wondering, I got shot down on the idea of a photoshoot with Toshinori, but he did want to hear from me what the 'in' fashions were.#$b# I... didn't think my opinion would matter to him. #$b# But the 'in' styles aren't HIS style, so we're going to meet up and compromise on a look.",
"6617.Haley.6": "Don't tell anyone I said this, but... things are going to get really weird around here without Toshinori.#$b#I'm glad I saw Izuku again, but, it wasn't for the greatest reason.",
 
//Sebastian
"6617.Sebastian.1": "Mr. Yagi seems kind of depressed.$s#$e#Not that I know anything about that.$s",
"6617.Sebastian.2": "I feel bad about what happened to Mr. Yagi's son. I invited him to hang out at the lake, just to relax, no obligation to talk. He said he might come.",
"6617.Sebastian.3": "I... appreciate Mr. Yagi wanting to look out for me, but... I'm an adult. Just because I still live with my parents doesn't mean I need them to treat me like I still need them.#$b# Least of all, Demitrius...#$e#I mean, neither of my parents really understand my work or my interests. Why single out my step-dad?#$b#Something just doesn't add up about this outburst...",
"6617.Sebastian.4": "I had a feeling Toshinori singling out my dad had more reasoning behind it than just what he saw at face value. I'm glad he's getting the help he needs to come to terms with his past.#$b# ... Could be worth looking into for myself, I guess.#$e#... Maybe... I'll ask Demetrius what he thinks.",
"6617.Sebastian.5": "Mr. Yagi and I didn't really click, but not in a bad way. We just come from two very different worlds.#$b#But you can still feel like something is really missing. This hollowness.#$b#He's right there, but he's not... here. You know what I mean?",   
 
//Elliott
"6617.Elliott.1": "I invited Mr. Yagi to my cabin the other day, but he declined! I guess he was worried he was imposing?",
"6617.Elliott.2": "I saw Mr. Yagi's son, Izuku, at the beach. I brought him some fresh-squeezed lemonade. He was so grateful he burst into tears. Poor kid.",
"6617.Elliott.3": "I heard about Mr. Yagi's breakdown through the grapevine. Word travels quickly in a tiny town.#$b# Ever since, there's been this... aura about him whenever he comes the beach. I'm nervous to draw close to him.",
"6617.Elliott.4": "Ah, the miracles of science and medicine! It's as though Mr. Yagi is a young man again.#$b#Well... approaching young. My point is, he seems reinvigorated now that he has the proper resources at his disposal.",
"6617.Elliott.5": "'So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.'$s",

//Sam
"6617.Sam.1": "My brother really likes reading with Mr. Yagi at the library. Can’t say I know him very well, myself. I think he's good friends with my dad, though.",
"6617.Sam.2": "Mr. Yagi has a kid that's my age? Just how old is that guy, anyway?",

"6617.Emily.5": "Things are going to change very drastically very quickly for Pelican Town.$s#$b#But then, they'll go back to normal.

There's no logic in two adults fighting like children the way we did.#$b#I never stopped to consider how never having his own family may have impacted just how strongly he felt about how others treat their family.#$b#I don't know if our relationship will ever entirely mend, but I hope we can take what each other said to heart to improve ourselves for the better.#$e#If you'll excuse me... I think I need to have a conversation with Sebastian.",

"6617.Willy.3": "I feel terribly for making light of Toshinori's plight before. The gentleman shouldn't feel the need to hide his sorrows and worries behind concern for others.#$b# I made sure he knew my door was always open to him. I may not do conversation well, but I can listen at least.",
"6617.Willy.4": "I almost feel like we should have had his service held down at the beach.#$b#I know it's not reasonable, with all the sand, and it's hard for some folks to make it down there, but... that was Toshinori's place. His comfort spot.$s",

"6617.George.4": "Everyone's saying that Toshinori's sick in the head from the war, but I don't care! He's been rude to me ever since he moved here!",
"6617.George.5": "... What? Here to gloat? That I was unreasonably cruel and unjust for no good reason?#$b#...#$b#*Sigh*$s#$b#I know I was. It does me no harm to just let other people be, even if I don't agree with it.#$b#You get old, and you get bitter, and you think you know what's best for everybody after you've made your own mistakes in life.#$b#I may not... approve of Toshinori's lifestyle, but how does what he does hurt me?#$b#And trust me, I tried REALLY hard to find that reason.#$b#...

"6617.Gus.2": "Izuku's a good kid. I offered to give him a free meal, but he paid anyway, then asked me if he could help me clean up the bar!#$b# Of course, I turned him down. I mean, even if he wasn't badly burned, I can't have a guest doing so much work!",
"6617.Gus.3": "Toshinori told me about everything that's gone on. I try to keep my nose out of things like that. Kind of the opposite of what you'd expect of a barkeep, huh?#$b# Well, I'm just glad he's going to therapy for what troubles him. Hopefully it'll bring back some of his appetite for life!",
"6617.Gus.4": "I'll never shake the habit Toshinori got me into about asking about dietary restrictions for any passing face at the Stardrop Saloon.#$b# Really, it's a habit I think any customer service worker ought to have.

"6617.Linus.1": "Nature has healing properties. It will be good for Mr. Toshinori Yagi to bask here in Stardew Valley.#$b#He doesn't know I exist. But I know him. It's thanks to people like him that this valley is as safe as it is.$h",
"6617.Linus.2": "Mr. Yagi's son came up to the mountain. I visited with him, invited him to my tent, and shared with him some tea I made from the valley's own bounty.#$b# He is a very polite, thoughtful boy, who came to me with no judgement or fear at all.#$b#It... was nice to be treated like I'm human.",
"6617.Linus.3": "Someday, he'll fully return to the earth. He'll be welcomed with open arms.",

I sent him a free jar of pickles after that.",
"6617.Pierre.2": "I think that young man visiting is Mr. Yagi's son? He stopped by earlier and bought a bag of candy.#$b#Wonder if he'd get along with Abigail?",
"6617.Pierre.3": "Toshinori is very 'in and out' ever since he started getting tense. I miss his visits; he would spend time almost like he was marveling at my products.",

"6617.Alex.3": "I feel bad about what my grandpa was saying about Toshinori. @, if you see him, would you let him know I've got his back?#$b# Hopefully, that would help him feel better, knowing someone's on his side of the field.#$e#I mean, what does it matter what Mr. Yagi wears? No one says that when girls wear guy clothes.#$b#If it isn't weird for girls to do it, why should it be for us?",

"6617.Alex.5": "It's like losing Mom all over again... I don't think funerals will ever get easier for me.$s",

//Shane
"6617.Shane.1": "That Toshinori guy gives me the creeps. He's tall, boney, and almost always smiling.#$b# It's weird. He's weird.#$b# He tries to make conversation with me in the Saloon since he sits so close to me. Doesn't he get that I'm trying to wind down for the day?",
"6617.Shane.2": "I want to give George a piece of my mind for stomping on Toshinori's heart like that.#$b# People like us... we have to look out for each other. But starting a fight with an old man is the last thing my reputation needs.#$b# I'll have to settle for offering my support to Toshinori.",
"6617.Shane.3": "I feel pretty stupid for not seeing the signs of Toshinori's PTSD. I don't have the same condition, but as another mentally ill guy, I should've had his back better, and not just against external forces.#$b# Sometimes you forget sometimes you're your own worst enemy, even after you've already fought that battle. Thanks for picking up my slack.",
"6617.Shane.4": "I had to fight tooth and nail to get the time off to come to this.#$b# For all the joy Toshinori brought to this town... I'd be a real piece of garbage to miss saying one last goodbye.", 

//Leah
"6617.Leah.1": "Toshinori comes out to the woods sometimes for the quiet and to think. I've invited him to my cottage a couple times, but he seems content to bask in the wilderness.",
"6617.Leah.2": "Toshinori's been very stiff-shouldered ever since he got in that fight with Demetrius about the way he treats Sebastian.#$b#I mostly agree with him, but I'm also not a parent; I don't fully understand what it's like to raise a child, especially one whose life you entered midway through.",
"6617.Leah.3": "I wasn't about to let him hold a knife, but I let Toshinori come in the other day and direct me in making a wood carving. Abstract, of course.#$b# It... didn't really seem to turn out to be anything, but he seemed satisfied. Whatever was tugging at his heart, I think we carved it away together in that moment.",

I'm shocked and hurt, really.$s#$b# Yes, Sebastian is my son and I love him dearly, but there's no right for anyone outside of the family to be making such bold accusations and claims.$a#$b#I hope this isn't indicative of something more long-term.$s",
"6617.Robin.3": "I had a feeling there was more to Toshinori's anger at Demetrius and Sebastian's relationship than just outside observation. After meeting Izuku, I really should have factored his love for that kid-- and, really, all kids.#$b# I still don't excuse his outburst, but I do forgive him. I hope he finds what he's looking for in therapy.",
"6617.Robin.4": "I'll still never forget helping Toshinori put together his freshly-made bedframe in that little corner room in Harvey's clinic.#$b# His smile was so brilliant, and his eyes were so bright.

//Pam
"6617.Pam.1": "Toshinori? Yeah, I know the guy. Sits at the opposite end of the bar from me at the Stardrop Saloon.#$b# I tried buying the guy a drink once, but it sounds like he can't have any. A crying shame!",
"6617.Pam.2": "I know you're close to that damn Toshinori Yagi. I don't need you lecturing me on my lifestyle choices, too!#$b# You shouldn't butt in where you're not wanted. I'm not in any kind of trouble, so unless you're here about something else, scram!",
"6617.Pam.3": "Hmm... bad memories. We all want to escape 'em, kid. Sometimes, we lash out looking for that escape.#$b# We know it isn't actually gonna get us there, but it dulls the pain for a moment, to let whatever's on your mind out, even if it's toxic crap.#$b# Or, if you're like me, or hell, Shane, you look for something stronger to dull out what hurts.#$b# Toshinori's got the right idea, looking for outside help. Part of me wishes I had the funds and the will to do the same.#$b# Part of me, though? Isn't ready.#$b# But, until then, I'll try to pay more attention to what I'm doing to myself and how that impacts others.#$b# Because even if my way of life wasn't the exact cause for Toshinori's misery, it played a part, and it's not just him I've been hurting. #$b#So, you take care. And take care of him, too.",
"6617.Pam.4": "It's a damn shame... that was a man that deserved far longer than he got.#$b#But, I dunno. Maybe this world didn't deserve him. Maybe Yoba decided we'd had him for long enough. Or, maybe, we didn't get the hint what he was really here for, and Yoba decided it was a waste to make him keep suffering.#$b#The powers that be work in mysterious ways, kid.",

"6617.Marnie.3": "Shane told me about Toshinori's recovery! Well, his upcoming recovery. What a relief!#$b# Jas was so confused why she wasn't seeing Mr. Yagi around. Hopefully, their visits together at the museum can resume soon. But first, here's hoping Toshinori's recovery goes well!",
"6617.Marnie.4": "Jas is a smart girl. She helps me with sick animals sometimes on the ranch, and knows what it means when one of them is gone in the morning.#$b# Because of that, she has been very strong about Yagi's passing. I don't expect it to last.#$b# The death of a person isn't quite the same.",

//Jodi
"6617.Jodi.1": "I had Toshinori over for dinner the first month he'd moved here.

"6617.HarveyEdit.2": "Maybe Toshinori's body was suffering heavily towards the end, but his heart wasn't. I think, even as someone whose job is to tend to the physical, that it's better to be happy in mind if you have to choose.",

"6617.AbigailEdit.5": "You know, most people wouldn't look back at a memory like this with fondness, but...#$b# The last time Mr. Yagi and I played pool with the other guys, he ended up coughing blood all over the table.#$b# Fortunately, Sam made a great big show of spilling his water and 'cleaning it up' to spare him the embarrassment of telling Gus.#$b# If you look hard enough, there's still one barely-there splotch.",
"6617.AbigailEdit.6": "Is this what the end is like?$s#$b# It is all just... doom and gloom, until you drop?$s#$b#Sorry, I was just... thinking about Toshinori.$s",

"6617.AlexEdit.3": "I bet Mr. Yagi would be great at Gridball if he were in better health. You've seen how tall he is!",
"6617.AlexEdit.4": "But I know he isn't suffering anymore. A tired body can only go on for so long before it gives out.#$b#But just like my mom, Toshinori was happy in the end, too. That's invaluable.",
"6617.AlexEdit.5": "Just knowing how... lifeless he was towards the end... I'm not sure whether to feel sad that was what the last days of his life were like, or relieved he isn't experiencing that anymore.$s",

//Evelyn
"6617.EvelynEdit.1": "When Toshinori first arrived, he didn't leave the clinic very often.$2#$b#It worried me so I came to his home with a batch of cookies! We've been close ever since.",
"6617.EvelynEdit.2": "People pity Toshinori. He's been through enough. What he needs is compassion.$2",
"6617.EvelynEdit.3": "Even if he isn't able to eat much, it's always a pleasure to bake for Toshinori.#$b# If you ever stop by after he visits and there's leftovers, you're welcome to help yourself, dear.",
"6617.EvelynEdit.4": "Toshinori came in the other day with sand in his hair! It must be wonderful to spend so much time down by the beach.#$b# I don't have the strength to get down there often by myself much anymore.",
"6617.EvelynEdit.5": "Tomorrow is Toshinori's birthday.#$1#He won't tell anyone how old he is!",
"6617.EvelynEdit.6": "Toshinori confessed that our first meeting reminded him of how much people care. It made an old lady's heart warm.",

"6617.EvelynEdit.9": "Toshinori looks so much happier. Thank you so much, @.",
"6617.EvelynEdit.10": "I hate to imagine what life would have been like had George not come to his senses and let Toshinori be in peace.#$b#I would have lost a dear friend, forever.#$b#Hmm? Oh, this is no loss.#$b#It's only 'goodbye for now.' I will see Toshinori again soon.",
"6617.EvelynEdit.11": "%Evelyn is too choked up for words. She must be thinking of Toshinori.",

//Gus
"6617.GusEdit.1": "The first time we met, I kept making dish after dish for Toshinori and sending him home with them! He always politely took them off my hands.#$b#Then, I found the untouched left-overs were thrown away when racoons got into the clinic's garbage!#$b#Turns out... he couldn't eat any of them.$2",
"6617.GusEdit.2": "Toshinori comes in to the saloon and buys himself a meal, but I think he does that just so he doesn't feel like he's loitering or taking up space.#$b# I wish I knew how to approach a conversation telling him he doesn't have to buy anything to spend time at the bar.",
"6617.GusEdit.3": "Doctor Harvey glances at Toshinori too often in the Saloon.#$b#Toshinori is sick but I think Harvey worries too much.",
"6617.GusEdit.4": "Hey there, @! Have you seen Toshinori lately?$2#$b#He didn't look too great, last time I saw him.$1#$b#He tells me not to worry but that's impossible! He's a good friend of mine.",
"6617.GusEdit.5": "Toshinori keeps me on my toes.$2#$b#He can only handle certain foods and even then it's difficult.#$b#But I do love a challenge!$1",

//Pierre
"6617.PierreEdit.1": "Toshinori doesn't always come in in the best of moods, but who can blame him? Certainly not I!#$b# Plus, it would be bad customer service.",
"6617.PierreEdit.2": "Abigail seems to have really taken a liking to Mr. Yagi. She's always had a penchant for the... ahem, 'unusual'.$1",

//Linus
"6617.LinusEdit.1": "I hear Robin and Sebastian talk about Toshinori sometimes. He truly does have a good heart.#$b# May the air of Stardew Valley preserve it.",

//Kent
"6617.KentEdit.1": "Toshinori guided my way when I was still wet behind the ears. I really believe I wouldn't still be here were I not a member of his squadron.",
"6617.KentEdit.2": "When I tell you a guy can eat, I mean Toshinori could EAT.#$b# We were going to try to have him eat an entire cow on his own.#$b#Well, until...$s",
"6617.KentEdit.3": "Thanks. For looking out for him. He needed that.",
"6617.KentEdit.4": "I hate that he only was able to find release from his torment in death. It isn't fair. It isn't right. He deserved better than that.#$b#... He deserved better than me.$s",

//George
"6617.GeorgeEdit.1": "I don't know what Toshinori's got to smile about, but he's always got that smirk like he knows somethin' I don't.#$b# It gets on my nerves.",
"6617.GeorgeEdit.2": "My wife was talking about this letter Toshinori sent her.#$b# A letter, I tell you! They're neighbors! What they got to be sending each other letters for? And why is some fella sending letters to MY wife?!",
"6617.GeorgeEdit.3": "... Yoba be damned. I think Toshinori Yagi is a better beacon of goodness and grace. Life threw everything it had at that man, and he stayed smiling and joyous.#$b#If I had even HALF of that kind of strength...",
"6617.GeorgeEdit.4": "George mutters something about Toshinori under his breath. You aren't sure you want to bother to find out what it was.",

//Lewis
"6617.LewisEdit.1": "There's constant talk of getting Toshinori his own home here in Pelican town, but, as much as I hate to admit it, that's all it is, is talk.$s#$b# There isn't much room to house an entirely new structure.$s",
"6617.LewisEdit.2": "Have you gotten any letters from Mr. Yagi yet?#$b# He sure likes to write!",
"6617.LewisEdit.3": "As I get older, I try to find happiness in the little things. Toshinori was always a beacon for that kind of mindset, as well.#$b# I'm relieved he took that with him into the next phase of... well, whatever you'd like to call it.",
"6617.LewisEdit.4": "I can't stop thinking about Toshinori... he suffered so much at the end of his life.$s",

//Haley
"6617.HaleyEdit.1": "For as... homely, as he is-- what? I know it's a big word, Emily was using it the other day!#$b# Anyways, for as homely as Toshinori is, he's... not a bad guy.",
"6617.HaleyEdit.2": "You know, seeing Toshinori at the beach so often has got to make you wonder what goes on inside that guy's head.#$b# Not that I'M wondering about it or anything!",
"6617.HaleyEdit.3": "I was going through my drawers the other day, cleaning stuff out. Emily made me do it to take my mind off things.#$b# I... I found some pictures of Toshinori.#$b# If you wanted to... stop by and look at them with me later... I guess I'd be okay with that.",
"6617.HaleyEdit.4": "I don't want to sound like a brat, but it's probably for the best Toshinori's gone.$s#$b# I know how that sounds! I'm coming from a place of concern. That guy was seriously not okay these last few months.$s#$b# Now, no one will hurt anymore... including Toshinori. Right?$s",

//Sebastian
"6617.SebastianEdit.1": "It was weird; I saw Mr. Yagi at the beach the other night. It was pouring, but there he was anyways.#$b# His face looked funny... all twisted up.",
"6617.SebastianEdit.2": "Mr. Yagi tried to talk to me a little at the Saloon.#$b# I tried telling him about my job, but the way he was smiling and nodding, I knew it was flying right over his head.#$b# At least he went through the effort to listen.",
"6617.SebastianEdit.3": "Toshinori may have been coming from a strange mental place at the time, but he really changed the way my family interacts with me as a whole, not just Demetrius.#$b#I just wish I knew how to feel about it. I'm involved now, and they're involved with me.#$b# It's weird. Most people would be happy. But I'm just... coping, I guess.",
"6617.SebastianEdit.4": "I don't know if I'll ever know why Toshinori talked to my dad the way he did that day.#$b# Things will never be the same between us, though. And we just have to live with that. He doesn't.",

//Elliott
"6617.ElliottEdit.1": "I was playing the piano when I heard a knock at my door. To my surprise, it was Mr. Yagi!#$b# I was able to convince him to come inside for a private concerto. I believe he loved it, if the dreamy look in his eye was any indication!",
"6617.ElliottEdit.2": "Mr. Yagi asked me about my writing process when I joined him on the beach recently.#$b# I know he writes letters rather frequently; he must have been wondering how to add some emotion to his own words so they could better translate on paper.",
"6617.ElliottEdit.3": "I was thinking of writing an instrumental piece to honor Toshinori's spirit.#$b# He was very fond of my writing, but I think, when I played for him, the reverberation of the piano through his tired bones brought him a soul-deep peace.#$b# And, as it's something I'm less versatile in creating, I believe the effort in composing the music would most greatly do him justice.",
"6617.ElliottEdit.4": "A man departing from this mortal coil unhappy is a man departed too soon...",

//Sam
"6617.SamEdit.1": "I offered to teach Mr. Yagi how to skateboard. It was mostly a lighthearted joke, you know?#$b# But he actually seemed interested in the idea... and then he turned me down like I originally expected.",
"6617.SamEdit.2": "Sometimes, Mr. Yagi plays with Vincent in the sand at the beach. It's... kinda weird, watching them.#$b# Maybe because something about Mr. Yagi reminds me of my dad.",
"6617.SamEdit.3": "I overheard Dad crying to Mom last night. Don't tell him I said anything.#$b# He said so many things, about how Mr. Yagi was such a great man, that the world was bleaker without him.#$b# I never knew him like Dad knew him, but I think I agree.",
"6617.SamEdit.4": "I overheard Dad crying to Mom last night. Don't tell him I said anything.#$b# He's really cut up about how things ended for Mr. Yagi. Said he didn't deserve to go so unhappy. He's also scared he'll end up the same.#$b# ... I don't know what I'd do if dad ends up like how Mr. Yagi did.",

//Emily
"6617.EmilyEdit.1": "It's expensive to have crystals shipped to Pelican Town, but I had it done for Mr. Yagi's sake.#$b# His room at the clinic is so bare. The positive energies of the gemstones should lift the shadow of the room considerably!",
"6617.EmilyEdit.2": "Mr. Yagi came by with one of his shirts with a hole torn in it and asked if I could patch it up for him.#$b# Don't tell him I'm putting a flower on the inside, close to his heart. It'll be our secret until he finds it!",
"6617.EmilyEdit.3": "Don't be sad. When Toshinori left us, he was happy. I could feel it in his spirit.#$b#He departed feeling satisfied. And sometimes he still comes to visit.",
"6617.EmilyEdit.4": "When we die, we shed the things that troubled us in our lives, be it a mental or emotional setback, or even physical ailments.#$b# Toshinori will hopefully be free from all that hurt him so terribly in life now.",

//Maru
"6617.MaruEdit.1": "Mr. Yagi is sometimes more open to talking to me than he is to Harvey.#$b# I think he gets tired of his hovering sometimes... and yes, Harvey does hover.",
"6617.MaruEdit.2": "Being able to work with Mr. Yagi almost every day I was at the clinic was really special.#$b# But I'm only realizing that now. Funny how that works, huh?",
"6617.MaruEdit.3": "Harvey and I did what we could for Toshinori in the last few months of his life, but... I think his fighting spirit just gave out.#$b# Sometimes, that's something science and medicine just can't fix.$s",

//Penny
"6617.PennyEdit.1": "Mr. Yagi had to duck out of reading time due to a coughing fit. Vincent and Jas were very upset. They wondered if he was sick.#$b# It was hard finding the right words to explain to them he had been injured without bringing up Vincent's own father...",
"6617.PennyEdit.2": "It's no news to me people look down on my mother. If I don't overhear it spoken, I see it in the looks they give her, and to me, especially from Mr. Yagi.#$b# But my mother isn't a bad woman. I won't even say she's different. She just... goes about life in a way most people think is incorrect.",
"6617.PennyEdit.3": "We didn't speak much towards the end of Toshinori's life. I regret that deeply.#$b#He'll never know how much change my mother went through as a result of his words, even if they were said in a moment of weakness.#$b# There's space for food in the cabinets now that all the bottles are gone. I make dinner for my mother and I. We... we have family time.#$b# It's not much, and it's... awkward, at best, but... it's the start of something new.",
"6617.PennyEdit.4": "Please excuse my mother if she seems... off.#$b# She may have had a bit too much last night. Well... more than usual.#$b# ... I hate it as much as I'm sure you do. It isn't right. Even if Mr. Yagi was... well, I don't have the words, but I'm sure you know what I mean.#$b#It's disrespectful. I know it is. But I don't know if it can be helped anymore.",

//Caroline
"6617.CarolineEdit.1": "Mr. Yagi prefers to spend time with Evelyn for tea rather than me. That's totally fine; I understand they're likely closer in age and have more to connect over.#$b# ... At least, I think they're closer in age than he and I are.",
"6617.CarolineEdit.2": "Pierre and Toshinori have this strange exchange whenever the latter comes in to buy food. It feels very... scripted.#$b# Mr. Yagi is always very polite and cordial, but it doesn't feel the same as when he's talking to me or Abigail. Pierre doesn't notice it.#$b# It must be a mother's instinct.",
"6617.CarolineEdit.3": "I suppose we can all take solace in knowing Toshinori died happy in life. Not everyone can say that.#$b# It was a battle, to be sure, but... it was one he won.",
"6617.CarolineEdit.4": "I don't know what to say... Toshinori struggled fiercely in his final year. Abigail talked to me about it all the time, but neither of us knew what to do.#$b#He just wasn't the same.",

//Demetrius
"6617.DemetriusEdit.1": "Robin and Toshinori get along fine, but whenever he and I talk, it doesn't feel the same.#$b# We're probably just not well enough acquainted yet.",
"6617.DemetriusEdit.2": "Maru talks a lot about the time she spends with Toshinori while working at Harvey's Clinic.#$b# However, their careers, both past and present, are like night and day. I don't know what Maru gets out of extended conversation with him.",
"6617.DemetriusEdit.3": "Whatever was said in the past between us, good or bad, means very little now.#$b# Still, I hope Toshinori died knowing just how positive of an impact he had on so many of us here in Stardew Valley.#$b# This town will never be the same without him.",
"6617.DemetriusEdit.4": "Hopefully, Toshinori moved on peacefully, even if his life ended on what some might consider a sour note.#$b# If we could pick the time we go, things would have been very different, I think. I think our families may have stayed friends, because I think he never would have let himself live long enough to lash out at all.#$b# ... But I will always wish we could have made ammends.",

//Vincent
"6617.VincentEdit.1": "Mr. Yagi talks about my dad sometimes. He says he's a hero!",
"6617.VincentEdit.2": "I saw Mr. Yagi go to the woods the other day!#$b# Jas says, Jas told me he just stands there by the lake for a really long time.#$b# What's he doing? I wanna know!",

//Willy
"6617.WillyEdit.1": "For all the time Toshinori spends on the beach, he seems reluctant to pick up a fishing rod.#$b# He doesn't have anything to fear; the fish don't bite!#$b# ... Well, they do, but not people.#$b# ... Usually.",
"6617.WillyEdit.2": "Toshinori is awfully quiet whenever he's at the Saloon.#$b# He seems to be more of a people watcher than a people person.",
"6617.WillyEdit.3": "They say Yoba is a deity most closely associated with agriculture, but I like to think the being saw all that Toshinori endured and let him have an endless beach with soft sand and perfect waves.#$b# Goodness knows the poor man earned a happy afterlife, the one he wanted.",
"6617.WillyEdit.4": "Yoba be willing, the tumultuous waves of that man's mind should be at peace now that the storm of his life has passed.#$b# Maybe his first few years in Stardew Valley were only the eye of the storm.#$b# Maybe now, he can rest on safe shores.",

//Shane
 "6617.ShaneEdit.1": "So that Toshinori guy wears dresses sometimes, according to my goddaughter, Jas.#$b# I have yet to see it for myself though.#$b# ... not that I WANT to see it or anything.",
 "6617.ShaneEdit.2": "When you hang out at the saloon as often as I do, you notice when there are faces missing. Toshinori was gone. He was probably too sick to come.#$b# He doesn't actually drink; I think he just comes for the company.#$b# He must've been bummed.",
 "6617.ShaneEdit.3": "I hate going to Harvey's clinic. He always lectures me about my health. But... Toshinori probably gets lonely there.#$b# And boy, don't I know what that's like.#$b# It'd probably be easier for me to go to him than the other way around.",
 "6617.ShaneEdit.4": "Heh... this guy. Always smiling, even on his worst days.#$b# It helps that he had so many people who cared about him so much.#$b# I wish I would have cared more. Besides the alcoholism, we were like the same person in two different skins.#$b#... I think smiling even when he didn't want to helped.",
 "6617.ShaneEdit.5": "This is... hard. It's like looking in a mirror for what my own future could be, or could have been like.#$b# Dying unhappy, bitter with the world.#$b# Looking at him laying here... it doesn't seem like a release.#$b# It just looks like an end.",
 
//Leah
 "6617.LeahEdit.1": "Toshinori came over to see what I was painting at the beach. He said it was really good!#$b# I was so taken aback, I didn't know how to tell him it was one of my worse pieces...",
 "6617.LeahEdit.2": "I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be in Mr. Yagi's head...#$b# N-not in a creepy way! My art just comes from my thoughts and emotions. I wonder what kind of art I'd create if I were in his shoes.",
 "6617.LeahEdit.3": "It's hard to let go, @. It's hard to move on.#$b# But... I think Toshinori would be upset if we wallowed in our sadness over losing him.",
 "6617.LeahEdit.4": "I can't believe Toshinori died like that.#$b#I should have been more involved in his life.",

//Clint
 "6617.ClintEdit.1": "Toshinori surprised me the other day by stopping by the forge. He asked if he could sit by the fire for a while. I thought it was a little strange, but I said sure.#$b# Now that I think about it, he probably wanted to pretend he was sitting by a fireplace. The saloon wasn't open yet, after all. Maybe he just couldn't wait.",
 "6617.ClintEdit.2": "*Sigh* I wonder if Toshinori can relate to having girl troubles...",
 
//Jodi 
"6617.JodiEdit.1": "Vincent really looks up to Mr. Yagi, since he knows his father. I'm so grateful Toshinori is so kind and sweet to Vincent.",
"6617.JodiEdit.2": "Kent stayed up late last night telling me stories about Toshinori when they were in the war together. I think it helped make today easier for him.#$b#He wasn't left with bitter memories to approach his casket with.",
"6617.JodiEdit.3": "Kent feels like he saw a ghost of himself in the future, with the way Mr. Yagi was in the last months of his life. I spent all night consoling him that it won't be that way.#$b#But if someone who was as bright as Toshinori could fade away so severely... I'm not so sure if I can help Kent from going down the same path.$s",

//Marnie
"6617.MarnieEdit.1": "Sometimes, Toshinori stops by to say hello. If it's the weekend, he even gets Shane to come out of the house.#$b# Though I think a main driving factor in his visits is to also say hello to the animals.",
"6617.MarnieEdit.2": "I watch Shane sometimes when I'm at the bar the same night as him. Sometimes he would chat with Toshinori, and one of them would say something, and the other would laugh, and laugh, and laugh.#$b#They had a surprising amount to connect over. I think this will be very hard for Shane in the long run. Friendships aren't something he's been able to maintain, besides for Toshinori.",
"6617.MarnieEdit.3": "Animals can sense when something is wrong with a person. I'm sure you knew that, @.#$b#They doted on Mr. Yagi when he would stop by, even at the end of his life and his heart hardened. They knew there was still some of the kind, gentlehearted man they knew before in there.#$b#The last time he visited, they surrounded him, nudging their heads into his hands and sides.#$b#It was like a blessing.",

//Pam
"6617.PamEdit.1": "Toshinori asked me what I do with my hair to keep it so nice. He sounded surprised!#$b# I was surprised he'd seek out beauty advice from someone like me! Ha ha ha!",
"6617.PamEdit.2": "I never wanted to hurt anyone. Well, except for myself.#$b# You live long enough being looked down upon, and you figure that's just what life has in store for you. You start treating yourself the same.#$b#You don't think about how that can hurt others, and if you do, you don't care.#$b#Why should other people matter to me anyways? I don't matter to them.#$b#... Toshinori never thought that way. The guy always loved everyone, and loved fiercely, even if he was hated.#$b#He never deserved the hand he was dealt. I don't think any of us really do.#$b#But he did what he could with his cards.#$b#... Guess it's my turn, now.",
"6617.PamEdit.3": "Sure, maybe the guy didn't like me. Who can blame him? I never claimed to be perfect.#$b#Toshinori had his own problems in the end, but that doesn't matter to me now.#$b#I just hope Yoba has love in their heart for someone who was clearly unwell and needed love this world just didn't have enough of for him.",

//Robin
"6617.RobinEdit.1": "I keep offering to make Toshinori some more homey touches to his room at Harvey's clinic, but he keeps insisting he has enough.#$b# When he gets his own home, I'm going to make sure to spoil him for all his patience.",
"6617.RobinEdit.2": "Toshinori can't make the journey up the mountain, so I try to stop by to say hello when I'm in town.#$b# We don't talk as often anymore now that he's settled in, but I like to think we're still good friends.",
"6617.RobinEdit.3": "Sometimes, Clint and I talk at the bar together about what kinds of things we can make for Toshinori to make his life easier.#$b# I know of course we should ask what he actually is looking for, but he doesn't always open up about that kind of thing.",
"6617.RobinEdit.4": "I would have hated for our time with Toshinori to come to an end with a feud still ongoing between our families. He was so fortunate to have your help, @.#$b#We all owe you immensely for helping Toshinori make his final months worth living.",
"6617.RobinEdit.5": "I hate that things ended for him this way... but maybe now he can rest easy.#$b#I'm going to try to remember him as the bright, loving man that first came into town asking about residency...",
