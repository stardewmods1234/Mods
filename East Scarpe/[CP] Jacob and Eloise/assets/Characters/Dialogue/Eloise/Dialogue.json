    "Introduction": "Hi! I'm Eloise, but you can call me Ellie if you like. You're the new farmer, right?",
    "Mon": "Can I come poke around on your farm sometimes? I'm sure it's filled with all sorts of interesting things!",
    "Mon2": "There's a stray cat that lives near the beach. She's super-skinny and scared. I've been trying to make friends with her, but she's not keen on the idea...",
	"Mon4": "I wanted to explore the cave on the beach, even though Dad said it's too dangerous, and I should stay out of it.#$b#It was real dark and scary, and made me feel all kinds of shivery. I made a strategic retreat!$3",
	"Mon6": "Why do people have to fight, farmer @? I've got a friend in the Gotoro Republic.#$b#His name's Sora. He's real nice and not even a little bit bad!",
	"Mon8": "What's your favorite animal, farmer @?#$b#Yeah, they're pretty neat! But I like pelicans best!$1",
	"Mon10": "You know, farmer @, Dad's been lonely ever since Mom died. You could move in and keep him company. I wouldn't mind sharing him, not with you!",
    "Tue": "Do you like birds, farmer @? Cos if you don't then we can't be friends.",
    "Tue2": "Jas is my bestest friend in the whole world, even if she mostly wants to play with dolls.",
    "Tue4": "I fell out of a tree today and skinned my knee! But don't worry, Ms Marnie patched it all better - look at the pretty plaster!#$b#Don't tell Dad though, he'll be ever so cross.",
    "Tue6": "Ms Marnie's a great cook. I wouldn't mind if she wanted to marry my Dad.#$b#But she just laughed when I asked her to consider it.$3",
    "Tue8": "The stray cat caught a sparrow yesterday. I tried to save it, but I couldn't...$2#$b#Dad says that once a cat gets them, it's too late. If they don't die of fright they die of an infection.$2",
    "Tue10": "I'm writing to ask the Governor to help the people in Gotoro.#$b#It's our fault that Sora and his family are homeless. We're the ones that invaded their land!",
    "Wed": "Wanna come and visit our ranch sometime? You could meet Princess Midnight and Sir Flufflekins!#$b#And we've got a parrot too - his name's Richie, and he's a macaw! He knows heaps of words and not all of them are polite!",
    "Wed2": "Do you explore the caves, farmer @? I bet they're home to all sorts of really cool critters.#$b#Some types of swifts live in caves. They make their nests out of saliva.$1#$b#And in some countries they eat the nests! Ick, can you imagine eating someone's spit?$3",
    "Wed4": "You know there's some birds that live in caves? They're called oilbirds. And they fly in the dark using echolocation - just like bats, but not as well!",
    "Wed6": "I think Ms Pam likes my Dad. She's always fluttering her eyelashes at him.#$b#I don't like her. She smells like beer and it makes me queasy to my stomach.#$b#Plus sometimes she's mean to Miss Penny, and Miss Penny is the loveliest person in the whole wide world!$2",
    "Wed8": "Richie used to belong to my grandada, and he taught him lots of naughty words!#$b#But parrots live a really long time, and when Grandad got too old to look after him, Richie came to live with us.",
    "Wed10": "I'm happy just living with my dad and lots of animals, but sometimes dad seems sad.#$b#I think he's lonely. Maybe you could come over sometimes and keep him company?",
    "Thu": "I'm going to be an explorer one day! Maybe I'll even discover a new animal.",
    "Thu2": "You've gotta be careful if you go on the beach after dark, cos the nocturnal rock crabs come out to hunt for sandworms and stuff on the beach.#$b#Once I saw one as big as a cat!#$b#They're bad though, cos they also eat baby birds and pets - and sometimes even foolish children.",
    "Thu4": "Sometimes after the rain, I go looking for shells on the beach.",
    "Thu6": "Do you know what an invasive pest is, farmer @? It's an animal that doesn't live naturally in a place, but is introduced there by people - sometimes on accident, sometimes on purpose - and displaces - that means pushes out or kills - the animals that already live there.#$b#Like the rock crabs that live on the beach. Dad says we need to keep them under control, or they'll spread onto the other beaches and maybe take over the whole world!",
	"Thu8": "I'm worried abour Sora. It must be so scary living in Gotoro. I wish there was a way we could get him safe here - and his Mom and baby sister too.",
    "Fri": "Dad's real smart, but he's also real busy, so I'm glad Miss Penny can teach us stuff!#$b#Jas is my bestest friend in the whole wide world, and Vinny's okay. For a boy!",
    "Fri2": "Miss Penny says I ask a lot of questions. Too many for her to keep up! But there's just so much I want to learn!",
    "Fri4": "Miss Penny told us to choose our favorite animal for a project. I chose the pelican, cos they're wicked-cool, and Jas picked blue jay.#$b#Vinny chose a spider - a common house spider, to be precise - and brought it to class in a matchbox!$1#$b#Miss Penny was not impressed.$3",
    "Fri6": "Vinny said that only 'girly-girls' wear pink dresses and stuff, and I wasn't a girly-girl cos I like to climb trees and dig through leaves looking for bugs and stuff.#$b#But I can wear pretty dresses too, if I want to, can't I?#$b#I think he's jealous; his mom won't let him dress up nice cos he gets himself dirty all the time.",
    "Sat": "You've gotta be quiet if you're gonna watch birds. Dad says I'm a regular chatterbox - but I do know how to shush!",
	"Sat2": "Princess Midnight is the laziest cat in the world. She almost never leaves the house.#$b#So, I'm not worried about her catching my bird friends.",
    "Sat4": "Lots of berries grow here in spring and fall. That's why the birds love East Scarpe!",
    "Sun": "Dad always visits Mom on Sundays. It makes him kinda sad. I miss her, even though I don't remember her too well.",
    "Sun2": "We're going to the beach! Maybe I'll find some pretty shells. My favorites are the really colorful ones.#$b#And the pelicans make me laugh. They're such funny looking birds.$1",
    "Sun4": "Did you know birds descended from dinosaurs, farmer @? The first birds were called the archae- Archaeopteryx. It means 'feather wing'.#$b#It's funny to think that dinosaurs might've looked like pelican or geese!",
    "summer_Mon": "Summer's boring for bird-watching. The Fern Islands are covered in fruit and stuff, so they go on vacation - just like people do!",
    "summer_12": "I'm going to the beach tomorrow, farmer @! The crested flamingo stop here to eat before migrating to Gotoro. Wanna come watch for them with me?",

   
    "ArchaeologyHouse": "Miss Penny's a pretty good teacher. She knows all sorts of things about the valley.",
    

    "spring_1_2": "Yay, it's spring! Have you got any baby animals on your farm? ",
    //"winter_16_2": "Hey, have you caught a blobfish yet, farmer @?#$b#They live in really deep water under loads of pressure, and when they're pulled up, their bodies decompress and they become all weird and blobby.#$b#It's gross and sad. You should leave them alone.$2",
    "winter_24": "It's Winter Star tomorrow! Are you excited for the gift giving?#$b#Dad's promised me a new pair of binoculars! What do you wanna get, farmer @?$1",
    "winter_24_2": "Hi farmer @! Who's your secret gift-getter this year? Is it me? *giggles*",
    "summer_28": "The jellyfish visit tonight, so Dad's letting me stay up extra late!$1",
    "winter_Mon": "Did you know that some animals sleep all winter, farmer @. Sometimes I wish I could sleep all winter too. It's so cold!#$b#But then I couldn't build a snowman or have a snowball fight with Dad. So maybe winter's not all bad.",
    "winter_Thu": "I wrote to Sora and told him all about snow. I don't think it snows where he lives. Except maybe on the tops of mountains.",

    "JasperGone1": "Professor Jasper's gone on a big adventure! He's looking for the dwarves - and promised me a pretty stone.$1#$b#But the caves are real scary and full of nasty things... I hope he comes back soon.$2",
    "GOABB": "Jas told me a real scary story about guns and a giant blue bunny. It was all about war, like the war in Gotoro.$3#$b#How does Jas know so much about war? I dunno... but I think she's got a new friend and she won't share him with me.$2",
    "LucikielArrives": "Did you see the monster-man? Jas said he's real scary and made her feel like throwing up.$2#$b#I wish I could've seen him... I wouldn't have been scared!",

    "Eloise_Duck_Y": "Um... corn, lettuce, peas, oats, even seeds!",
    "Eloise_Duck_W": "Of course he does! He loves it. Like I love pink cake!$1#$b#But if I eat it all the time, I'll get fat and sick. And so will he.$2#$b#Corn, lettuce, peas, they're much better for him!",
    "Eloise_Duck_G": "Sure! Grapes are okay.#$b#Corn, lettuce, peas, they're good too!",
