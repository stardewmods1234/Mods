    "DwarfCave.2": "It looks like it's been crumpled heavily:^\"Dearest Marnie,^I have wanted to tell you how I feel for the longest time, but my tongue grows tangled. I fear I have been too long without company, and can no longer find the words.\" It's unsigned, but you're fairly certain it wasn't written by Dwarf.",

	"FilingCabinet.1": "The Stardew Inquisitor: HUNTED BY A TALKING BEAR?^^A group of trampers camping near Stardew Valley Gorge had a close encounter with a bear last week. \"We were partying pretty loud,\" one student, who would only identify himself as 'Brad', told the News. \"I mean, we were in the a-- end of nowhere, who were we gonna disturb? Then we heard a rustling in the bushes and, sh-- I damn near p--ed myself. There was, like a massive bear, six, seven feet tall, and almost as wide. It just stared at us. I guess I just totally panicked and chucked my bottle at it. The beggar caught it in one hand, grinned at me, and said - and I kid you not! - clear as day, 'Thank you'. Then it trotted off into the forest.\"^^When asked if they had been partaking of illicit substances, 'Brad' became suddenly mute.",
	"FilingCabinet.2": "The Stardew Inquisitor: SLIME PLAGUE!^^Strawberry Fields was ravaged by a hoard of slimes during last night's new moon. \"They destroyed everything!\" the distressed Orchadist informed our reporters. \"And left behind a foul goop that's poisoned the land. What are we to do?\" The local Adventurer's Guild has been approached for comment, but have yet to return our calls.",
	"FilingCabinet.3": "An article from Farmer Life Monthly; it's a few years old:^^The tiny village of Pelican Town is renowned for its rich and fertile soil which, combined with its relative high humidity, provide optimal growing conditions. If the rumors are true, seeds planted in Pelican Town's soil will sprout faster and produce a greater yield than those outside the area. It seems almost criminal to report that Pelican Town's last large scale farming operation ceased production XX years ago, and the land was allowed to fall into disrepair. It is said to have been inherited by the Farmer's grandchild, and we can but hope that one day they shall claim their birthright.",
	"FilingCabinet.4": "A series of petty burglaries have been reported around the Stardew Valley region. One eyewitness claimed to have woken at night to hear strange noises, and found a small person rifling through their refrigerator. The perpetrator fled on foot and is believed to have escaped via a mine shaft. \"They were short,\" the witness reports, \"possibly a child, and wearing a starnge lumpy hood. I couldn't see their face.\" So far, stolen items consist of food, trinkets, and scrap metal.^^People living in the area are encouraged to keep their doors locked, and secure all valuables away until the thief, or theives, are apprehended.",
    "FilingCabinet.5": "Mr. MacGregor, proprietor of 'Many Clucks Given', a free-range chicken farm outside Grampleton, reported a strange occurance in his hen barn this morning. \"The girls were extremely restless,\" he said. \"And I was worried at first about vermin. But instead I found the weirdest thing: several of the eggs had turned black, speckled with red, and there seemed something faintly ominous about them.\" When asked what he did with the corrupted eggs, he shuddered. \"I disposed of them,\" he said. A pity, we at the Inquisitor feel, for it would have been interesting to see what hatched.",
    "FilingCabinet.6": "THEFT AT LOCAL MUSEUM: The tiny township of Pelican Town suffered further heartbreak today, when their museum curator departed abruptly - and took all of their small regional collection with him. \"It's a sad loss for the region,\" Mayor Lewis informed us. \"All that local lore, just gone!\" A theft report lodged at the time suggested that a number of books had also been taken, and that the collection contained several rare and unusual gemstones, endemic to the region.^^Local archeologist, M. Gunther, has stepped into the role as curator, although how long will the display cabinets remain bare? Only time will tell.",
	"FilingCabinet.7": "LOCAL FARMER 'WOWS' WITH GIANT PUMPKIN:^^Stardew Valley farmer, M. Terence of Fairhaven took the grand trophy at the Stardew County fair this past weekend, when he presented his impressive 2,465 pound pumpkin to a gobsmacked audience. \"The secret's in the seeds and the soil,\" he informed us. \"You have to fertilize it and take care to water it everyday.\" When asked what would become of the gigantic fruit, he joked that he might: \"hollow it out and turn it into a playhouse for the kids.\"",
    "FilingCabinet.8": "INFERNO RAGES UNDER PELICAN TOWN:^^It's been more than twenty years, and the coal fire beneath Pelican Town is still burning.^^The coal ignited in XXXX after a gas explosion that killed 26 miners and injured dozens more. Attempts to smother the fire have failed, but it is reported to be confined in the deepest levels of the mines, held in check, our sources report, by \"caverns filled with perennial ice\" No, the science doesn't make any sense to us either.^^Despite this, Pelican Town is still a charming little seaside village, and attracts dozens of tourists annually.",
    "FilingCabinet.9": "Stardew Valley Tribune, almost a decade ago: Stardew Search and Rescue have called off a search for missing Pelican Town resident, Tristan, three days after he failed to return from a spelunking expedition.^^Tristan, and his girlfriend, Mona, were last seen together on sunday morning, when they are believed to have entered Pelican Town's extensive cave system. Close to midnight, Mona arrived home in what her guardian described as 'a confused and bewildered state'. She is currently receiving medical care for mild hypothermia. \"I don't know what's wrong with her,\" a friend - who wished to remain anonymous - informed us. \"She kept whispering, over and over again, 'I should never have left the cat...' but she doesn't even like cats!\"",
    "FilingCabinet.10": "It's a formal letter with the Stardew Valley crest, dated several years ago:^^To Mayor Lewis,^With the last census showing that the population of Pelican Town has fallen below 100, the Stardew Council have made the decision to assimilate it into the greater Grampleton region. The ruling of Pelican Town will now fall under the jurisdiction of the Governor.^^Now Pelican Town no longer requires an independent mayor, your role will become ceremonial in nature. We are grateful for your dedication and service to the Ferngill Republic, and wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. It is our hope that you will take this opportunity to enjoy an early retirement.^^With gratitude and respect, the Governor.",
    "FilingCabinet.11": "You've found a faded newspaper article, about fifteen years old:^JOJA's HEIR VANISHES^^Joseph Jacobson Jr., the sole son of Joja Tycoon, Joseph Jacobson, has disappeared.^^Joseph Jr. was scheduled to take over the role on Monday, after the self-made billionaire's extravagent retirement party on Saturday night. However, an eyewitness reports that they saw Joesph Jr. \"sneaking out the back door around midnight.\"^^A secret liaison gone wrong, or perhaps the Joja way of life no longer appealed? A friend of Joseph Jr. reports that the man had become increasingly disatisfied with the Corporation, particularly the manner in which Joja handled disagreements over the recent Trade Treaty with the Gotoran Republic.^^The disappearance is not being regarded as suspicious; Joseph Jr. has always displayed reticience towards the public eye, but all sightings should be reported to the local police.^^During his absence, the management of JojaCorp will be handled by a committee, overseen by Joseph Sr.",
    "FilingCabinet.12": "It's an obituary:^^Mona of Pelican Town, beloved daughter, mother, sister, left us today, Spring the 28, after a tragic accident. Taken too soon, the world will be a darker place without her fierce and fiery spirit. May she rest now, bathed in Yoba's light, reunited with her dear Tristan.",
    "FilingCabinet.13": "It's an advertisement:^^PEST CONTROL SPECIALISTS^Have slimes oozed into your basement? Does a monster lurk under your bed? Your friendly Adventurer's Guild are here to help!^\"Free Quotes\"^^Call Marlon or Gil on XXX-XXXX-XXXX.",
    "FilingCabinet.14": "STARDROP CHEF TAKES OUT REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP^^\"It's all down to my secret sauce,\" Gus, owner of the Stardrop Saloon, claimed, while accepting the trophy in yesterday's Stardew Valley Culinary Contest. Contestants came from all over the Stardew Valley region, with dishes ranged from escargot to tom kha soup. But it was Gus's spaghetti that won the day. \"I made the pasta myself,\" he added. \"And the ingredients are all fresh and locally sourced.\" He would not divulge the ingredients of his 'secret sauce', only that it was a recipe that had been in his family for generations.",
    "FilingCabinet.15": "JOJACORP PURCHASES THE 'INFERNO MINES':^^Mega corporation, JojaCorp, recently purchased the abandoned mines north of Pelican Town. Once a thriving gem-and-coal mine, it was abandoned XX years ago, after a series of explosions killed 26 miners and ignited the coal seam. JojaCorp's local head, Morris, refused to comment on the acquisition, and would not divulge the corporation's plans for the area.",
    "FilingCabinet.16": "LOCAL TOWN BESIEGED BY \"STORM OF THE CENTURY\": A freak storm lashed the coastal township of Pelican Town at 6pm last night. Fierce wind gusts - some exceeding 55 mph - and a deluge of rain led to several homes evacuating to the local saloon. Several buildings were destroyed in the storm, including the town's community center; a further blow for the once prosperous mining villge.^\"We shall recover from this,\" states Pelican Town's Mayor Lewis. \"Pelican Town has weathered many storms. Our community shall survive.\" Whilst his faith in his community is admirable, it must be noted that the population has dwindled significantly since the closure of the mines, XX years ago.",
    "FilingCabinet.17": "HONEY THIEF FOILED BY LOCAL GRANNY: Evelyn \"Granny\" Mullner is being hailed a hero tonight in Pelican Town, after she succesfully fended off a hungry bear - armed only with her gardening tools.^^\"I was gardening,\" the intrepid grandmother informed us. \"When a large bear strolled out of the forest. I think the poor thing was just hungry - but he gave me quite a fright! I swatted him on the muzzle with my rake.\" The bear then trotted away, looking quite distraught.^^\"I actually felt rather sorry for him,\" Granny Mullner continued. \"But we can't have a predator hanging around the children! I did leave some maple syrup on a tree stump in the woods though. I guess he accepted my apology: the bottle was empty - licked quite clean! - the next day.\"",
    "FilingCabinet.18": "It's a scrap of stained paper, torn from a notebook:^^The valley has not been at ease since the mines ignited. They awoke a foul fiend in its depths; somewhere beneath the surface, something dark and shadowy slumbers. Is this the entity referred to as the 'void'?^The corruption has crept through the caves like a blight, twisting bats into monsters and mutating harmless crustaceans into horrifying beasts.^It is our duty to regain the balance between the -^^Here the text is disappears beneath a rusty brown stain.

Then the Adventurer's Guild need YOU!^^The creatures of the void are becoming increasingly bold and possess a threat to the fine folk of Stardew Valley.^^If you feel you have what it takes to become a Defender of the Valley, call in at the Adventurer's Guild and speak to Marlon or Gill.^^*Recruitment will involve a physical test. The Adventurer's Guild are not responsible for loss of life or limb incurred during this process.",
    "FilingCabinet.20": "What is the Stardrop?^^There are many who have pondered the existence of this mysterious fruit, noted throughout Stardew folklore for its energizing properties. Those, it is said, who consume the stardrop can never be killed, and there are rumours that it may contain the secret to immortality.^^What we do know, however, is that lore of it is endemic to the Stardew region.",

    "FilingCabinet.22": "TOWN UNDER SIEGE BY AVIAN THREAT: Chestervale is under assault again, this time by an unlikely assailant: a goose!^^\"The varmint plucked up all my carrots,\" a local gardener informed us, \"and dropped my keys in the river. Locked me out of my own garden!\"^^\"He's really scary,\" added a small boy. \"And he stole my glasses!\"^^The goose's reign of terror was eventually brought to an end after it was cornered and captured in a local beer garden.^^When asked to justify its crimes, all it replied was, \"HONK!\"",
    "FilingCabinet.23": "Stardew Valley Tribune, over twenty years ago:^NEW MAYOR TAKES THE POST IN PELICAN TOWN: M. Lewis accepted the role as Mayor of Pelican Town today, after a landslide win in the local elections.^^\"I have great plans for this town,\" he announced. \"We hope to bring her to the fore of the Stardew Economy, to really make our mark on the map.\"^His opposition, Guildmaster Marlon, conceded the loss gracefully.",
    "FilingCabinet.24": "A page, torn from a notebook:^What lies beneath Stardew Valley? The caves that riddle Stardew Valley's mountainous terrain are filled with secrets. Strange artifacts have been found, including technology of which we do not understand, and the high occurance of iridium ore suggests the possibility of meteoric strike. That, combined with local folklore pertaining to the 'Winter Star', the endemic and mysterious fruit known as the stardrop, and the outstanding fertility of Pelican Town's soil, all point towards something not entirely of this world.^^I believe further research is required.^^M. Jasper.",
    "FilingCabinet.25": "JojaCorp will begin drilling in the North Sea today, as the Ferngill Republic seeks oil reserves within its own borders. The Republic seeks to break ties with the Gotoro Empire, against which border and treaty disputes have lead to increasing tension between the two neighbors. After the signing of a trade treaty in XXXX, the Gotoran Empire has been steadily inflating the price of raw petroleum, leading to restrictions across the Ferngill Republic.",
    "FilingCabinet.26": "The Stardew Inquisitor:^^Today, the 7th Spring, as rain cascaded around us, our intrepid parapsychologist Crystal Moonbeam ventured onto Pelican's Town tidal beach following rumors of a spirit that appears there under such conditions. After fording a small stream, she caught sight of the figure: An elderly man in a large hat. \"The rain seemed to haze around him,\" Moonbeam reports. \"Like he was there...but somehow also not there. He looked me in the eyes, and said in a voice like the creaking of deep sea timbers, 'I see ye have that gleam in ye eye, miss, but I'm afraid she does no' feel the same way about ye.'\"",
    "FilingCabinet.27": "A page, torn from a notebook:^Dear Gunther,^The goblin folk of Bluemire have no written language, but they are skilled orators, and have preserved their cultural history through tales and interpretive dance. It has been my honor to attend several performances - something few outsiders are permitted. There is a recurring theme of a war: a collision between the shadows and a \"bright and fierce light\" that resulted in centuries of turmoil, and bears a striking resemblance to Rasmodius's tales of the Elemental Wars.^Alas, my time amongst their kind was cut abruptly short, after an unfortunate misunderstanding... - I shall spare you the details, my friend! - But needless to say, a hasty retreat was in order!^^Yours, M. Jasper.",
    "FilingCabinet.28": "TAKEN BY THE FAIRIES?:^^Four hours after she was reported missing by her worried guardian, seven-year old Mona was finally found alive and well in the woods west of Cindersap Forest. \"I was having a tea party with the fairies\", she informed her rescuers. \"They gave me a magic necklace!\" She appears none the worst for her adventure, although she refuses to parted with the necklace: a simple crystal on a leather cord."
