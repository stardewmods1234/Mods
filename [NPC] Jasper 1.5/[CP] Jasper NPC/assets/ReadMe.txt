Special thanks to Airyn for the new and improved sprites and the gorgeous portraits!

CONFIG OPTIONS:

JASPERPORTRAITS:
Options: Original/Airyn/Archer
You can choose:
* Original: for my older, leaner and more worn looking Professor
* Airyn: for the slightly younger, less worn, and handsome, but still fairly scruffy.
* Archer: for a handsome and slightly more confident Jasper. 

FARMCAVE CHANGE:
Options: True/False
This mod adds a slightly larger farm cave with a "secret" passage and healing spring.
It can be congifured TRUE or FALSE.
If you are using another mod that adjusts your farm cave, set it to "False".
(automatically disabled if using Immersive Farm 2)

SOCIAL GUNTHER AND MARLON:
Options: True/False
Adds the two older men to the social menu and makes them giftable.
Even if this is set to "false" you will be able to talk to both of them (they just won't have as much to say) if you can reach them.
* Both will be automatically disabled if SVE, Befriend Marlon and Gunther, or Marlon/Gunther is Real is installed. 
* Gunther is disabled if Museum Expansion is installed.
(some of the dialogue from this mod will be added to Museum Expansion, SVE, and Gunther to NPC, none if Marlon/Gunther is Real are installed)

PREGNANCY TALK
Options: True/False
If you marry Jasper and your character is capable of bearing children, there are some additional bonus scenes, plus dialogue etc. If you'd rather no one acknowledged your pregnancy, select "false".
Please note that Jasper and some villagers will still talk about the fact that you're expecting a child, but there won't be any uncomfortable pregnancy related dialogue (not that it goes into much detail, and you may get some gifts too!).

Marriage to Jasper has not been 100% tested, although I have played through and tested the 14-heart event in its entirety. There may still be some dialogue issues. I have amagamated some concepts from Immersive Spouses.
Events relating to childbirth/rearing may trigger early or late. If this happens, please let me know.

Jasper has added features to be compatible with:
- Stardew Valley Expanded
- Reimagined2
- Karmylla's maps
- Unique Courtship Responses
- Unique Jealousy Responses
- Immersive Spouses (yes, it is worth installing this).
- Jasper has added dialogue with: Denver, Cecilia, Museum Expansion, East Scarpe, Lucikiel.
- All my mods are compatible with each another.
- Multiplayer (not 100% tested, however).

You may run into some conflict if you are running him in conjunction with the Haywrites Monster Pack as I have added dialogue for Dwarf as well. This shouldn't crash your game but may make for inconsistent dialogue.


KNOWN BUGS:
If you do not install the DLL file, Jasper will not become datable. This is due to a limitation with the code, where if you married Jasper, Jas would stop talking. A HUGE thanks to Jonqora for writing the code that fixed that problem! 
If you do not intend to marry him, it can be safely ignored. Hopefully we will convince SpaceChase to add it as a feature of Custom NPC Fixes.
The child in one of his "baby" scenes will always be white. I tried it with a configurable dark child, but it was not succesful. Hopefully in future we will have baby sprites to personalise the child.
Some weirdness may happen if you dove your child as soon as it's born. But why would you want to do that anyway?

SPECIAL THANKS TO:

Airyn, Archer, Jonqora, Hesper, Kdau, Mouse, Pathoschild, Routine, and all the other modders from the Discord channel and beyond that joined me on this adventure. 
Jasper has come a long way since I first started this character at the end of 2019 - and so have I.
I hope you will grow to love my scruffy professor as much as I do.
